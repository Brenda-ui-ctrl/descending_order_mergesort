# Merge Sort in C#

This repository contains a C# implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm that sorts an array of random integers in descending order.

## Overview

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together. This implementation measures the time taken to sort an array of 1,000,000 random integers.

## Features

- Sorts an array of random integers in descending order
- Measures and displays the time taken to perform the sort

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

### Running the Program

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MergeSort.git
   cd MergeSort
